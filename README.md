# 📈 LSTM Time Series Predictor

Welcome to **LSTM Time Series Predictor**, a machine learning project built to forecast values using sequential data.  
This project was created as a **learning project** to understand how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks work for prediction tasks.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build and evaluate an LSTM model to predict future values based on past sequences.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
- **Dataset:** Open-source dataset (custom/real-world sequential data)
- **Algorithm Used:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Import the dataset, normalize the data, and create time series sequences.
- **Model Building:** Build an LSTM neural network model with appropriate layers and configurations.
- **Training:** Train the LSTM model on the sequential data to capture temporal patterns.
- **Evaluation:** Visualize the training history and compare actual vs. predicted values.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to forecast future sequences.

## 📊 Results
